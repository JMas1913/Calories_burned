I found this dataset on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). I looked for it because of my passion for health and fitness.
The original dataset had a list of activities and the calories burned per hour. 
From there, I used my knowledge as a personal trainer, health coach, and nutritionist to categorize the activities into buckets based on the calories burned and the person's weight class.
To end up with 3 different buckets: activity, exercise, and sport.
I then visualized the data and demonstrated how some visualizations would not be as compelling as others.
